---

This guide will help you to get familiar with Pacificsoft IoT Gateway configuration files and parameters.

Once you have installed Pacificsoft IoT Gateway, you can find configuration files in the following directory:

```bash
Linux: /etc/tb-gateway/conf
Windows: $INSTALL_DIR/conf
```

We will describe main configuration files below.

#### tb-gateway.yml

The main configuration file that is used to setup connection to Pacificsoft server and enable/disable extensions.
