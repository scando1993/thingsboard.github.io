Pacificsoft allows you to configure customizable IoT dashboards.
Each IoT Dashboard may contain multiple dashboard widgets that visualize data from multiple IoT devices.
Once IoT Dashboard is created, you may assign it to one of the customers of you IoT project.
 
IoT Dashboards are light-weight and you may have millions of dashboards. 
For example, you may automatically create a dashboard for each new customer based on data from registered customer IoT devices. 
Or you may modify dashboard via script when a new device is assigned to a customer. All these actions may be done manually or automated via REST API.
